# GitHub Directory Download Tool
This is a simple Python script for downloading specific directory on the GitHub repository.
I use Python to develope a prototype, and try to support a website service and "real command-line tool".
(But in fact, I guess it's not important... because you can use "svn" to do it.)


## TODO List
- [ ] Download
- [ ] Support command-line
- [ ] Create a website interface to download (such as DownGit)
