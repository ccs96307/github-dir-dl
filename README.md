# GitHub Directory Download Tool
This is a simple command-line tool for download specific directory on the GitHub repository.
I want to use Python to develope a prototype, and try to support a website service and real command-line tool.


## TODO List
- [  ] Parse the html code
- [  ] Recursive search
- [  ] Download
- [  ] Support command-line
- [  ] Create a website interface to download (such as DownGit)
